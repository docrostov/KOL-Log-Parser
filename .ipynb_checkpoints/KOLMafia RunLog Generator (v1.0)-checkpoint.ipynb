    "# KOL Ascension Log Wrapper (v2.1)\n",
    "_A Styling Project by Aaron M. (AKA Captain Scotch, #437479)_\n",
    "\n",
    "Hey all! This is a wrapper meant to isolate and analyze Ascension logs via Python, formatting everything into a clean Excel wrapper. Originally, this was simply an overlay of [CKB's run log parser in ASH](https://kolmafia.us/showthread.php?22963-RunLogSummary), which is fantastic, but as I'm more of a Python dev this quickly enlarged into a broader project that turned into a personal goal to build a Python log parser. That's in development right now! I tried to make it as clean as possible; let me know if you have any questions."
